# Neuron Incentivized Testnet
Neuron Incentivized Testnet is the final 2 weeks testnet before mainnet launch for those who will join the mainnet. 1% of initial supply of $GAME will be distributed according to the level of achievement of missions and ranker battles. Also GAME Foundation will select a set of validators to delegate its GAME (15% of initial total supply) based on our assessment on the results of Neuron Incentivized Testnet.

## Rewards
1. Total amount of Rewards will be 2000000GAME which is the 1% of initial supply.
2. Rewards will be devided as Mission Clear Reward (80%) and Ranker Share Bonus (20%).
3. rewards will be distributed at the time of mainnet launch (as genesis state).
4. rewards will be distributed to the address which is registered in the application form.
3. GAME Foundation will select a set of validators to delegate its GAME based on the results of Neuron Incentivized Testnet (Detail about delegation program will be announced later).

Check the detail [here](./detail.md).


In the mission No.3/No.4/No.5/No.6, the signer must be the address registered in the application form.

**Rewards Levels**: According to the percentage of achievement of tasks, there will be three reward levels:

| Total Points |  Reward coefficient |
| ------------ | ------------------- |
| 80+ (Gold)   |         1           |
| 70+ (Silver) |        0.8          |
| 60+ (Bronze) |        0.6          |

Indivisual Mission Clear Reward will be caliculated with the fomula below.

**MissionClearRewardPool = 200000000 * 0.01 * 0.8**

<!---
\begin{align*}
Mission Clear Reward = Mission Clear Reward Pool * \frac{My Level Reward Coefficient}{Number Of Gold Level * 1.0 + Number Of Silver Level * 0.8 + Number Of Blonze Level * 0.6}
\end{align*}

## Ranker Battles
20% of rewards will be distributed based on the Liveness Ranker Battle and Spam Tx Ranker Battle.

### Liveness Ranker Battle
 The main objective for the Liveness Ranker Battle is liveness, and each participant's rewards will depend on their ability to keep a connection alive. Participants will compete with jailed count and missed block count in the whole period (October 20, 2021 11:00 GMT - November 3, 2021 11:00 GMT). The winner will be the participant with the least number of jailed count and the least number of missed blocks. The jailed count has priority over the missed block count. The top 10 winners will receive prizes as follows.

| Rank |  Reward ($GAME) |
| ---- | --------------- |
|  1   |  50000          |
|  2   |  40000          |
|  3   |  30000          |
|  4   |  20000          |

|  9   |  10000          |
|  10  |  10000          |

### Spam Tx Ranker Battle

The main objective for the Spam Tx Ranker Battle is to stress test for the neuron network, and the winner will be the participant with the most tx posted in the Spam Tx Ranker Battle Period ( October 28, 2021 11:00 GMT - October 31, 2021 11:00 GMT). Participants must post txs from their address which is registered in the application form. Failed Tx will not be eligible to be counted. The top 10 winners will receive prizes as follows.

| Rank |  Reward ($GAME) |
| ---- | --------------- |
|  1   |  50000          |
