## GenTx Collection (~~Until October 17, 2021 11:00 GMT~~ End)
0. Install nibiru
```
git clone https://github.com/cosmos-gaminghub/nibiru.git
cd nibiru && git checkout -b neuron-1 tags/neuron-1
make install
```

Make sure to checkout to `neuron-1` tag.

1. Initialize the nibiru directories and create the local file with the correct chain-id

```
nibirud init <moniker> --chain-id=neuron-1
```

2. Create a local key pair in the keybase
```
nibirud keys add <your key name>
```

â€»Make sure to keep neumonic seed which will be used to receive rewards at the time of mainnet launch.

3. Add the account to your local genesis file with a given amount and key you just created.
```
nibirud add-genesis-account $(nibirud keys show <your key name> -a) 100000000000ugame
```

Make sure to use `ugame` denom, not `game` like nibiru-2000.

4. Create the gentx
```
nibirud gentx <your key name> 100000000000ugame --commission-rate=0.1 --commission-max-rate=1 --commission-max-change-rate=0.1 --pubkey $(nibirud tendermint show-validator) --chain-id=neuron-1
```

5. Create Pull Request to this repository ([neuron-1/gentxs](./gentxs)) with the file `<your validator moniker>.json`.

6. Submit [the application form](https://forms.gle/BHgLRhmyrHoWzLj17) to finish registration process completely.
